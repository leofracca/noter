Noter is an open source text editor written in C++, using Qt.
With Noter you can work on text files and do the essential operations like create, open, modify or save a file.

## Features
Noter includes the basic features that all text editors have.
- Text format in **bold**, *italic*, <ins>underline</ins> and mix them in the way you want
- Copy, cut and paste
- Zoom-in and zoom-out
- All the .txt and .xml files in the current directory are visible on a sidebar and it's possible to open them with a double click
- Find a word in a text
- Replace a word in a text
